java script is single threaded, synchronous fn 

event loop : 

call back fn: fn are first class citizen in java script , 
	means a fn can be passed to another fn, call call back fn.

callback fn gives the power of synchronisation to javascript.


# blocking the main thread:
    javascript has only one call stack or main thread.
    everything executed through call stack only.

    if any heavy operation taking multiple seconds to run will block the call stack, this is called blocking the main thread.
    that's why we shouldn't block the main thread.

    so,  use async await for those heavy operations.

# event listner:
    Q.Why do large codebase removes eventListners?
    ans: its heavy, it takes memory , forms closure, so we are not able to free up space, 
    so , we need to remove eventListners when we are not using it, so it can be garbage collected.
    if multiple buttons, so because of so much closure , page slow
